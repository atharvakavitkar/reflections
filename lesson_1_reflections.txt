How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?


Only the difference was shown.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
record of versions is record of ideas.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pro is personalisation and con is no power down security.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
multiple files are frequently linked in coding, text files rarely have interconnections. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows list of commits, git diff shows difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
can always return back to safety.
